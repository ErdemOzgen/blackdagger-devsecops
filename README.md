# Blackdagger DevSecOps YAML Files
This repository consists of YAML files that are created to be used in [Blackdagger](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/blackdagger) tool.
With these YAML files, we aim to provide you a quick start to perform common DevSecOps tasks, show you the format and mechanisms of Blackdagger YAML files and give you inspiration and ideas to modify these files or create new ones for your DevSecOps needs. You can find the descriptions of each step in the YAML files. 


# Blackdagger: Cyber Workflow Automation Framework
Blackdagger is a single binary tool that is capable of managing and automating complex workflows for various purposes. To improve the experience of users while using Blackdagger, various repositories that contains tested YAML files for complex workflows, easy-to-setup infrastructure for CART and DevSecOps purposes are suggested by the team. With major additions to these repositories, everything that makes Blackdagger better is collected under a framework called Blackdagger: Cyber Workflow Automation Framework.

The framework consist of 5 components:

- [**Blackdagger:**](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/blackdagger) Core of the framework for orchestrating the components and workflows
- [**Blackcart:**](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/blackcart) A specialized Docker container optimized for Continuous Automated Red Teaming (CART) and DevSecOps pipeline tasks.
- **Blackdagger YAMLs (this repository):** Pre-tested [example](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/blackdagger-default) workflows, demonstrating real-world [DevSecOps](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/blackdagger-devsecops) and [CART](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/blackdagger-cart) use-cases, facilitating quick adoption and adaptation.
- [**Blackdagger Github Infra :**](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/blackdagger-github-infra) A suite of advanced workflows utilizing GitHub Actions infrastructure for enhanced defense evasion techniques, scalability, and performance.
- [**Blackdagger Web Kit :**](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/blackdagger-web-kit) A browser extension integrating all core functionalities, enabling direct interaction and execution of Blackdagger workflows from within the browser.

Each component is compatible with each other to run on **any environment, for any case and as easy, fast and effective as possible.** The framework also enables adding, removing or modifying components to add extra features for new purposes.


# Features Provided With These YAMLs
- Setting up an environment for running various DevSecOps tools
- Installing DevSecOps tools for various purposes
- Example DevSecOps workflows for different kinds of projects

We will frequently update these YAMLs with support for more kinds of projects and more tools. Stay tuned!
